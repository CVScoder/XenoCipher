Phase 2: Default Mode
2.1 Key Generation & Exchange: Unchanged (NTRU + chaos).
2.2 Attack Detection: Unchanged (works on ciphertext bytes).
2.3 Adaptive Switching: Unchanged (key toggle applies to any data).
2.4 Document Support:
Method: Add encrypt_file()/decrypt_file():
Read file in 256-byte chunks.
Pad last chunk.
Apply XenoCipher per chunk, single header.
Why: Ensures scalability for larger inputs.
Duration: +1-2 days (file I/O logic).


Phase 3: ZTM
3.1-3.3: Unchanged (AI, NTRU + DH, key toggle).
3.4 Document Support: Same as Default Mode (chunking + padding).
Duration: +1-2 days.


Phase 4: XenoChat
4.4 Implementation:
Add file upload/send (send_file()).
Encrypt/decrypt files in chunks.
Display file transfer progress.
Duration: +2-3 days (UI + file handling).
Total: ~12-17 days.


Phase 5: Testing & Docs
Test file encryption (e.g., 1 MB PDF in both modes).
Document file support in README.
Duration: +1 day (file tests).
New Total: ~5-8 weeks.
